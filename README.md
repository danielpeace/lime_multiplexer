# lime_multiplexer

## Dataset
Image dataset is contained within the 'multiplexer_combined_bandwidths' folder. Data set is arranged into two classes, 0 or 1, based on simulated bandwidth of each mode.

## CNN


## Explanations
Running the LIME algorithm on the input data set will generate 'explanations', ie. which features after segmentation are most important for classifying input multiplexer designs into the two classes.
